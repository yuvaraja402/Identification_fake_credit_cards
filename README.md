# Identification of Fake Credit and Debit card :credit_card: combinations and payment networks during Payment Gateway
<b>Motivation</b> :thought_balloon: : During product :package: checkouts in <b>E-commerce websites</b> I have noticed as I type just 4 to 5 digits of my debit card :credit_card:, the website's payment system automatically identifies the type of card I have and its payment network. But to my surprise at the time of this project, the E-commerce websites like <b>Ebay and Amazon</b> did not recognise all payment networks. 

<b>Objective</b> :dart: : Develop a program that will identify fake credit card combinations by calculating card digits over Luhn formula. Also, successfully recognize credit cardâ€™s payment network provider such as <b><i>Mastercard, Visa, American Express, Discover and RuPay(India's newly government introduced payment network).</i></b>

### Disclaimer :
User data is not collected by this program. This project intention is to show how payment systems work to operate and functionalities that can be improvised. <b>For educational purposes only.</b>

[Executable program]() - Enables the user to interact with the program and run card validation. 

### Understanding Card and prefix's :
<i>Type of card</i> stands for <b>Debit and Credit </b>cards.

<i>Payment networks</i> stand for financial system that provides <b>payments</b> and <b>transaction services</b> to a customer from a merchant.

For <b>RuPay</b> card : The combinations that do not validate as Discover card fall under RuPay card combination.

### Verdict : 
This program serves the purpose in the prevention of payment frauds. <i><b>Source code can be integrated</i></b> with any E-commerce website and existing payment networks to recognise the type of cards :credit_card: and their payment networks.
