# Identification of Fake Credit and Debit card combinations during Payment Gateways
<b>Motivation</b> :thought_balloon: : During product checkouts in E-commerce websites I have noticed as I type just 4 to 5 digits of my debit card, the checkout system automatically identifies the type of card and payment network. But to my surprise at the time of this project, the E-commerce website did not support or recognise all payment networks. So, I decided to develop my program that will identify all payment networks.

<b>Objective</b> :dart: : Develop a script to identify fake credit card combinations at time of payments by calculating card numbers over Luhn formula. Also, successfully recognize credit cardâ€™s payment network provider such as <b><i>Mastercard, Visa, American Express, Discover and RuPay(India's newly government introduced payment network).</i></b>

### Disclaimer :
User data is not collected by this program. This project intention is to show how payment systems work to operate and functionalities that can be improvised. <b>For educational purposes only.</b>

### Quick links :link::
[Python code]()

[Executable program]() - Enables the user to interact with the program and run card validation. 

### Understanding Card prefix's :
Payment Network | Card Prefix's
----------------|---------------
American Express|3
Discover|65, 644, 645, etc
MasterCard|5
Rupay|6
Visa|4

For <b>RuPay</b> card : The combinations that do not validate as Discover card fall under RuPay card combination.

### Verdict : 
This program serves the purpose in the prevention of payment frauds. <i><b>Source code can be integrated</i></b> with any E-commerce website and existing payment networks to recognise the type of cards and their payment networks.
